<h2> The possible number of test that can be run is infinite. Really?</h2> 

<p> 		
--------	Intro 		--------------------- 

In my experience, when talking to a fellow tester we would happily agree that the number of possible tests that can be run is infinite. The most recurrent example is the calculator and the debate that you cannot test all the possible additions that can be made as nobody in his right mind will pass its time to add 1+1, 1+2, 1+3 …. 1 + 1001… 1 + 987689 …. and then 2 + 1, 2+2, 2+3 …. 2 + 1001 and so on.  I hope you get the idea.		 

		  		--------	centre		-------------------- 
When we test we need to examine the constrain of the text, the time and the 

But this made me thinking. Is 1+1 really different from 2+ 2?  In my eyes they are not. I am adding two numbers of one digiti only. 

The value in the test changes, not the test in itself. Addning 1 + 1 or 1 + 3 is  adding .. adding and multiplyin are two different tests.... 		What about common sense? would you really try all the numbers or a sample would suffice? 		How about CRUD? will you choose or try infinite times? what about time? 		


--------	conclusion  	-------------------- 		Tests are limited by the capacity of discerning and the time to run them 		



--------	summary 	-------------------- 		Choose wisely which tests to run, try to catch all possible bugs, be aware that some will always skip the net 		so do not say I'll run all the tests in the world because you cannot do that.
